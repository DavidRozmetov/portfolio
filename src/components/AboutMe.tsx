          I am a programmer from Turkmenistan and based in Bangkok, Thailand

        <p>
          I'm David, a determined individual who relocated to Bangkok in 2015
          and embarked on a self-taught programming journey in 2016. After
          studying IT at KMUTT and teaching private English in 2018, I switched
          to Siam University in 2019. Now, as a recent university graduate, I'm
          actively seeking a remote programming job to leverage my skills and
          passion for technology.
